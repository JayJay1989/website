The Crafting Grid is the same as a regular [[Grid]], but has a crafting inventory.

When an item is crafted, it won't just clear the crafting slots, but it'll try to retrieve the same items from the storage network again.

## Recipe transferring

The Crafting Grid integrates with [JEI (Just Enough Items)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/jei) so the player can use recipe transferring.

Refined Storage will warn you when you don't have the required item present in your inventory, storage network or crafting matrix. Even with this warning, you can still transfer items.

If you don't have some required items, but autocrafting is available for said items, you can press CTRL + CLICK to start autocrafting for said items. Note that you need a [[Pattern]] configured for these items.
