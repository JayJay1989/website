## Wireless
Refined Storage has extensive wireless abilities to access your storage network remotely.

Craft a [[Wireless Grid]] and right click it on a [[Controller]].

Craft a [[Wireless Transmitter]] and add it to your network. You can now access your storage in a radius around the [[Wireless Transmitter]].

Want a higher range? Simply place multiple [[Wireless Transmitter|wireless transmitters]] around your world, but not next to each other.

## Portable Grid
Want to access an individual [[Storage Disk]]? Use a [[Portable Grid]].

Give it energy and insert a disk and you're good to go. It doesn't depend on a storage network.

## Storage Monitor
Want to see how much you have of an item in your storage network? Connect a [[Storage Monitor]] and configure an item to display.

You can then see how much you have of that item and interact with it by inserting or extracting multiple items at once.
