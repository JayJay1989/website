A Storage Housing is a [[Storage Disk]] or [[Fluid Storage Disk]] without any [[Storage Part]] or [[Fluid Storage Part]] assigned to it.

The player can craft another [[Storage Disk]] or [[Fluid Storage Disk]] with this item by combining the Storage Housing with a [[Storage Part]] or [[Fluid Storage Part]] respectively.
