With the Wireless Crafting Monitor the player can see what is crafting from anywhere.

To activate the Wireless Crafting Monitor, the player has to right click the Wireless Crafting Monitor on a [[Controller]]. If you're playing on Refined Storage 1.7.x or higher you can bind the [[#name]] by right clicking on any connected network device.

To use the Wireless Crafting Monitor the item needs Forge Energy. You'll have to charge it in a block that charges items from another mod.

After doing all these steps, the Wireless Crafting Monitor is still missing a signal from the system. Add at least 1 [[Wireless Transmitter]] to the network to get a basic range of 16 blocks.

If the Wireless Crafting Monitor is ready for use, it will light up blue.

Sometimes, the Wireless Crafting Monitor doesn't open or stays grey. To enable it make sure that:

- The Wireless Crafting Monitor is bound to a [[Controller]]
- There is at least 1 [[Wireless Transmitter]] connected to the network
- That you are in range of the [[Wireless Transmitter]]
- The [[Controller]] block is still in the world on the place where you bound it to
