What if you want to move items, fluids, energy and don't let those go through your storage? Or transport a redstone signal?

Use the [[Reader]] and [[Writer]]. They use a channel system, and the transported items, fluids or energy are stored in the channel so they don't enter your system.

Use the [[Reader]] to take in, and the [[Writer]] to get out.
