The [[#name]] is a block that provides the system with storage. It is similar to the [[Fluid Storage Disk]], but can be placed in the world.

When breaking the [[#name]], the fluids that it holds persist, so you won't lose any of your fluids.

The [[#name]] won't despawn when dropped in the world.

## Priority
A (negative or positive) priority can be chosen (where a higher priority gets higher precedence to place items in).

## Whitelist and blacklist
There is also a whitelist and blacklist option to only allow or forbid some fluid from entering the [[#name]].

The whitelist or blacklist can be configured to be NBT or damage sensitive.

## Mode
The [[#name]] has support for the following modes:

- Insert and extract (default)
- Insert only
- Extract only

## Uncrafting
Sneak and right click while holding the empty [[#name]] to retrieve the various parts back:

- The corresponding [[Fluid Storage Part]]
- [[Basic Processor]]
- [[Machine Casing]]
