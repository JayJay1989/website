## How to create a translation
Copy https://github.com/refinedmods/refinedstorage/blob/mc1.15/src/main/resources/assets/refinedstorage/lang/en_us.json to a text file on your computer and replace the texts to your language.

## How to submit your translation
- If you know Git good enough, you can contribute new languages files via a pull request
- If you do not know how to use Git / Github,  upload the translation file to Pastebin or Gist [and send it to me through an GitHub issue](https://github.com/refinedmods/refinedstorage/issues)

## Updating existing translations
You can compare the new and removed translations keys yourself, [or use a Bash script I wrote](https://github.com/refinedmods/refinedstorage/blob/mc1.15/tools/missing-translation-keys.sh) that outputs a diff between `en_US` and the version specified.

You can of course always diff manually using another tool, like the `diff` utility or an online diffing tool.
