The Crafter Manager is a block that allows you to see all your [[Pattern|patterns]] in one GUI.

## Naming
All the [[Pattern|patterns]] are listed and categorized per [[Crafter]]. The categorization is based on the name of the [[Crafter]].

To decide which name a [[Crafter]] gets, the following rules (in order) are used:

1. If the [[Crafter]] is renamed with a Minecraft [Anvil](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Anvil), use that name
2. If the [[Crafter]] is connected to a machine in the world, use the name of that machine
3. Use "Crafter" as name

## Sizes
One can configure the Crafter Manager size:

- Stretched (default)
- Small
- Medium
- Large

When choosing the stretched size, the Crafter Manager will take up all the vertical screen space. This can be limited through the `maxRowsStretch` config option.
