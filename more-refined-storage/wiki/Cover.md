**NOTE: This block was removed in Refined Storage 1.7. The landscape for covers and multiparts in Minecraft 1.14.4 is a bit unclear, so time will tell if this feature returns, or if Refined Storage will utilise a multipart library if that is available.**

A Cover is an item used to hide [[Cable|cables]].

You can also hide blocks that have a cable on them, like the [[Importer]] or [[Exporter]].

It will block network connections, [[Cable|cables]] can't pass through the "hidden" side.

You can craft a Cover with a [[Cutting Tool]] and the block of your choice to use for hiding.
