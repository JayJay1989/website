Sometimes, you may have different areas all scattered throughout your world.

## The problem
Here is the problem: you want access to your Refined Storage system on all of those areas.

You could lay [[Cable]] from your base to every area, but what if said area is 1000 blocks away? Are you really going to craft 1000 [[Cable|cables]]? Didn't think so.

## The solution
Use the [[Network Transmitter]] and [[Network Receiver]].

Simply craft a [[Network Transmitter]] and connect it to your Refined Storage system in your main base.

Next up, craft a [[Network Card]]. I'll be telling what you need this for in a second, bear with me.

After crafting a [[Network Card]], craft a [[Network Receiver]] and place it in the area far away from your base.

Take the [[Network Card]] and right click it on the [[Network Receiver]].

Put the [[Network Card]] in the [[Network Transmitter]] so the [[Network Transmitter]] knows where to send a signal to.

And now you are done. Simply connect machines to your [[Network Receiver]] according to the normal machine connecting rules.

I suppose you could treat the [[Network Receiver]] as a [[Controller]].

## One very important thing to note
The [[Controller]] in your main base and the [[Network Receiver]] in the other area **both** have to be chunkloaded **before** linking it to the network.

After linking, both areas have to stay chunkloaded.

## Using Refined Storage 1.7.x or 1.8.x?
