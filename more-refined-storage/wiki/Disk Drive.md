The Disk Drive is the block in which you store [[Storage Disk|storage disks]] or [[Fluid Storage Disk|fluid storage disks]].

## Priority
A (negative or positive) priority can be chosen (where a higher priority gets higher precedence to place items in).

## Whitelist and blacklist
There is also a whitelist and blacklist to only allow or forbid some items or fluids from entering the [[Storage Disk|storage disks]] or [[Fluid Storage Disk|fluid storage disks]] respectively.

The whitelist or blacklist can be configured to be NBT or damage sensitive.

## Mode
The Disk Drive has support for the following modes:

- Insert and extract (default)
- Insert only
- Extract only
