The Filter is an item that can be used in any [[Grid]].

In the Filter's GUI, which can be opened by pressing right click while holding the filter in hand, the player can specify which items and fluids can be visible.

## Items and fluids
The Grid can filter fluids in the [[Fluid Grid]] and items in any other [[Grid]] by toggling between item and fluid mode.

## Filtering
The player can choose to let the filter be damage or damage sensitive. It is also possible to use a mod filter.

The Filter can be set in a whitelist or blacklist mode, too.

## Icon and name
The player can also configure an icon and name for the Filter.

In item mode, a item can be specified as an icon.

In fluid mode, a fluid can be specified as an icon.

As soon as the Filter has an icon specified, it will appear as a tab in the [[Grid]]. Then, open the tab to see the filtered items or fluids.

## Clearing
Use SHIFT + right click in your inventory while holding the Filter to clear it.
