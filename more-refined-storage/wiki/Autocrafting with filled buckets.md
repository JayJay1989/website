Some crafting recipes may require a filled fluid bucket. To use fluids from your fluid storage to fill buckets, you can set up a [[Pattern|processing pattern]] that has following inputs:

- 1 empty bucket
- 1000 mB of the fluid of your choice

For the output:

- 1 filled bucket

Put that in a [[Crafter]] that faces a bucket filling machine [that for example Thermal Expansion has](https://teamcofh.com/docs/thermal-expansion/fluid-transposer/). Refined Storage will output the fluid from your fluid storage, and, an empty bucket. It is up to the external machine to fill it.
