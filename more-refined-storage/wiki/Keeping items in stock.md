Create an [[Interface]] with a [[Crafting Upgrade]] in it. Then, specify the items that you want to keep in stock. The items will now be autocrafted if needed.

To make the stocked items available to your storage network, create an [[External Storage]] and put it on the [[Interface]].

Make sure the [[External Storage]] is in "extract-only" mode. That way, RS won't attempt to insert items in the [[Interface]] that is meant for keeping in stock.
