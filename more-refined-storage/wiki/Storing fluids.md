As opposed to only item storage, Refined Storage is able to store fluids as well. This is done in the entirely same way as item storages.

All the things you can do to manipulate items (with [[Exporter|exporters]] or [[Importer|importers]]) you can do with fluids as well.

## Storage
The same way as you connect item storages, you can connect fluid storages as well:

- [[Fluid Storage Disk]] in a [[Disk Drive]]
- [[Fluid Storage Block]]
- [[External Storage]] in fluid mode

## Accessing fluids
Use a [[Fluid Grid]].

## Manipulating fluids
Any block that would manipulate items can manipulate fluids as well by simply putting the block in fluid mode.

There is one exception to this: the [[Interface]] has no fluid mode. Craft a [[Fluid Interface]] for this.
