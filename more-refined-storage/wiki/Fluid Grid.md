The Fluid Grid is the same as a regular [[Grid]], but is used for viewing fluids in the fluid storage of your storage network.

## Inserting
To insert a fluid, players can shift click on a fluid container like a bucket in their player inventory while in the Fluid Grid GUI.

The player can also click the fluid container in the GUI to insert it.

## Extracting
Players can extract the fluid by clicking on it. The Fluid Grid will then fill a bucket with the selected fluid.

Refined Storage will first search an empty bucket in your inventory. If none is found, a bucket will be searched in your storage network.

Some fluids cannot be filled in a bucket, then the only way to extract those fluids is by using an [[Exporter]].
