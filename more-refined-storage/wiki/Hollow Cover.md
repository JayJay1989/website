**NOTE: This block was removed in Refined Storage 1.7. The landscape for covers and multiparts in Minecraft 1.14.4 is a bit unclear, so time will tell if this feature returns, or if Refined Storage will utilise a multipart library if that is available.**

A Hollow Cover is the same as a [[Cover]] but has a hole so you can pass [[Cable|cables]] through it.

You can also put it on the front of an [[Importer]] or [[Exporter]] (or any block that has a cable part) to hide part of the block.

It will let a network signal through.
